The project focuses on  automatic multiple-choice question generation to develop a robust and efficient system capable of automatically generating high-quality multiple-choice questions in multiple languages. Automating the process of multiple-choice question generation has various benefits. Automation significantly reduces the time and effort required to generate a substantial number of questions, allowing educators and trainers to focus on other essential aspects of teaching and content development.By using predefined rules and algorithms, the system can produce questions that adhere to specific guidelines, styles, and difficulty levels. This consistency helps maintain fairness and reliability in assessments, ensuring that all learners are evaluated on an equal basis.automating the process of multiple-choice question generation brings efficiency, scalability, standardization, customization, and improved learning experiences to educational institutions, trainers, and assessment organizations. It streamlines the question creation process, supports diverse question types and languages, and contributes to fair and effective assessments. Hence , the project aims to create a language agnostic model for creation of multiple choice questions in multiple languages.
